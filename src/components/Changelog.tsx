      "Major update focusing on EPKK-specific weather risk assessment. Implemented CAT I approach minimums for Kraków Airport, including automatic NO-FLY conditions detection for severe weather phenomena. The system now accounts for local geographical features and adjusts risk calculations based on seasonal patterns (October-February) and early morning conditions specific to Kraków's microclimate.",

      "Introduced comprehensive operational impact assessment with real-time delay predictions. The new de-icing prediction system provides estimated delay times ranging from 15 to 45 minutes based on current conditions. Added monitoring for ground operations status, including runway and taxiway clearing operations. The system now tracks Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) activation and provides warnings for single runway operations.",

Implemented rapid change detection that alerts users to deteriorating conditions before they become critical. Weather phenomena descriptions are now more precise and include detailed explanations of their potential impact on flight operations.",

      "Significantly improved the forecast system to focus only on relevant future periods. The new early warning system provides advanced notice of approaching weather changes, while the enhanced risk scoring system now incorporates local factors for more accurate predictions. Delay estimations are now more precise, taking into account multiple contributing factors.",

      "Completely revamped the user interface to provide clearer guidance and recommendations. Status explanations are now more detailed and include specific actions passengers should take. Weather advisories have been enhanced to provide more actionable information, and operational impacts are now more prominently displayed for better decision-making."

    date: "2024-01-04",
    version: "0.2.0",
    changes: [
      "Added a complete guide to EU261 passenger rights with real examples. The guide now clearly explains what compensation you're entitled to based on your flight distance and delay time. We've also included practical tips on how to claim compensation and what documents you'll need.",

      "Made the airport info much more useful by adding all the important contact numbers and current operating hours. You can now quickly find emergency contacts, lost baggage office numbers, and available transport options. We've also included seasonal schedule changes so you know exactly when services are available.",

      "Streamlined the interface by removing the flight tabs to focus on what matters most - weather conditions and passenger rights. This makes the app faster and easier to use, helping you find important information when you need it.",

      "Built step-by-step guides for dealing with delays and cancellations. Each guide walks you through exactly what to do, what papers you need, and how long things typically take. No more guessing what to do when things go wrong.",

      "Completely rebuilt the mobile experience to work better on phones. Everything's easier to tap, loads faster on mobile networks, and you can now access key information even when your connection is spotty."

  {
    date: "2024-12-24",
    version: "0.1.1",
    changes: [
      "Rebuilt our caching system from the ground up using the Cache API. It's now much smarter about storing and updating data, which means the app works better even with patchy internet. We've added fallbacks so you'll still get the information you need even if something goes wrong with the live data."
    ]
  },
  {
    date: "2024-12-16",
    version: "0.1.0",
    changes: [
      "Added a new departures board that shows real-time flight status, gate info, and estimated departure times. It works with all airlines operating at the airport and shows codeshare flights too.",

      "Built a smart caching system that keeps data for 10 minutes. It pre-loads frequently checked information and updates in the background, so everything feels faster and more responsive.",

      "Made the app much more reliable when the airport's API is having issues. It now tries again automatically if something fails, waiting longer between each try to avoid overwhelming the system.",

      "Added backup systems so you'll always see some flight information, even if the live data isn't available. We've also added checks to make sure all the data you see is accurate and up-to-date.",

      "Improved how we load flight data by showing up to 10 pages worth of flights. The app now loads this data efficiently and gets ready for what you might want to see next, making everything feel much smoother."
